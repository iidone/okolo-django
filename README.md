The OKOLO project is an alternative to Avito. A public marketplace where users can sell their things, as well as buy them. I plan to add a payment system via Yandex, or perhaps other methods. It is also worth noting that the name OKOLO itself is a play on the words "oko" + "lo", that is, an emphasis on the proximity of the place where you can buy a thing. Therefore, it is planned to implement a geolocation system to display the nearest sellers for the selected product category.
